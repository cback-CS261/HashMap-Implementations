Chaining:
This implementation utilizes LinkedLists. There is one class, HashMap, which represents a DynamicArray 
that contains LinkedLists at each index. The HashMap class contains several methods to interact with the 
table and the LinkedLists.

Open Addressing:
This file contains the implementation of a HashMap that utilizes open addressing and quadratic probing 
for resolving collisions.

There are two classes: one called HashEntry that represents a key, value pair entry into the hash table 
and HashMap, which represents a DynamicArray that contains HashEntries. The HashMap class contains several 
methods to interact with the table and its entries, including:
